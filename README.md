# Budget Tracker Documentation

## Overview

The Budget Tracker is a web-based application designed to help users track their income and expenses. The application allows users to add budget items, view total balance, and check records of their financial transactions. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js, Express, and MySQL for the backend.

## User Interface

The user interface is divided into two main sections:

1.	Budget item form: This section allows users to add a new budget item by specifying its type (income or expense), category, note, amount, and date.
2.	Records and total balance: This section shows the total balance and a list of all budget items that have been added.

The HTML code for the user interface is in the index.html file.

## JavaScript Functions

The JavaScript code is in the index.js file and contains several functions to handle different parts of the application:
- `setCurrentDate()` Sets the current date in the date input field.
- `handleTypeSelect()` Handles the change event of the type select element to populate the category options.
- `fetchAndCalculateBalance()` Fetches all budget items from the backend and calculates the total balance.
- `fetchAndDisplayRecords()` Fetches and displays all the records.
- `handleFormSubmission()` Handles the form submission event to add a new budget item.

## Backend Server

The backend server is built using Node.js and Express. It provides several endpoints to interact with the MySQL database:

- `GET /budget_items` Fetches all budget items.
- `GET /records` Fetches all records.
- `POST /budget_items` Adds a new budget item.

The server code is in the server.js file:

## SQL

In the Budget Tracker project, a MySQL database was used to store and manage budget items. The SQL commands used in creating the database, tables, and inserting records are as follows:

### Database Creation

To create a database, the `CREATE DATABASE` command is used:

```sql 
CREATE DATABASE budget_tracker;
```

### Table Creation

The `CREATE TABLE` command is used to create a new table in the database. In this project, a table named budget_items is created to store the budget items.

```sql
CREATE TABLE budget_items (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    note TEXT,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    date VARCHAR(250) NOT NULL
);
```

In this table:

•	id is the primary key, which uniquely identifies each record.
•	type stores the type of the budget item (income or expense).
•	category stores the category of the budget item.
•	note stores any notes related to the budget item.
•	amount stores the amount of the budget item.
•	date stores the date of the budget item.

### Inserting Records

The `INSERT INTO` command is used to insert new records into a table:

```sql
INSERT INTO budget_items (type, category, note, amount, date) 
VALUES ('income', 'job', 'Salary for the month of January', 5000.00, '2023-01-31');
```

This command inserts a new income item into the budget_items table.

### Fetching Records
The `SELECT` command is used to fetch records from a table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM budget_items;
```


This command fetches all records from the budget_items table.

5.	Paste the following SQL commands into the text box:

```sql
CREATE TABLE budget_items (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    note TEXT,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
